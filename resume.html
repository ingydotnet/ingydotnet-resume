<h1>Ingy döt Net</h1>

<p>Greetings! My name is <a href="http://ingy.net">Ingy döt Net</a>. I am a software artist and computer language inventor. My passion in life is to see computers solving the real world problems that society faces today. To that end, I continually look for new ideas to make software development simpler, while searching for more ways to socialize those ideas.</p>

<p>With over 25 years of work experience, I have been a vocal leader in <strong>Open Source Software</strong> for the last 20. I love solving problems in ways that benefit not only my current task, but the art of programming in general. I take the most pride in my works that help people of many programming languages at once. I&#39;ve coined this effort: <a href="http://acmeism.org">Acmeism</a>.</p>

<h1>Career Objective</h1>

<p>I&#39;m one of the 3 original authors of the <strong>YAML Data Language</strong>, and the only one of those who continues to work on YAML daily. I see a future for YAML that builds on its current success while addressing its many pitfalls, and making it grow to solve more real world, every day needs.</p>

<p>Cloud Computing has been my area of daily work for past 8 years. Recently I worked as a Distinguished Technologist at Hewlett Packard Enterprise&#39;s cloud division. While there I worked with OpenStack, Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, Ansible, Concourse.ci, Swagger/OpenAPI; all of which used YAML!</p>

<p>Cloud continues to rely more on YAML every day. YAML needs support as an industry language. I am ready, able and gungho to lead that effort.</p>

<p>I am currently looking for employment at a forward-thinking company that uses YAML as a core part of their industry leading projects. I&#39;d like to be able to help the company use YAML to its full potential; work with talented people who can help me shape the language; and lead the community effort to move it all forward.</p>
