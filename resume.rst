Ingy döt Net
------------

Greetings! My name is `Ingy döt Net <http://ingy.net>`_. I am a software
artist and inventor. My mission in life is to see computers solving the real
world problems that we humans face today. To that end, I continually look for
new ideas to make software development simpler, while searching for more ways
to socialize those ideas.

With over 20 years of work experience, I have been a vocal leader in **Open
Source Software** for the last 10. I love solving problems in ways that
benefit not only my current task, but the art of programming in general. I
take the most pride in my works that help people of many programming languages
at once.  I've coined this effort: `Acmeism <http://acmeism.org>`_.
