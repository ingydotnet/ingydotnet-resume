=head1 Ingy döt Net

Greetings! My name is L<Ingy döt Net|http://ingy.net>. I am a software artist
and computer language inventor. My passion in life is to see computers solving
the real world problems that society faces today. To that end, I continually
look for new ideas to make software development simpler, while searching for
more ways to socialize those ideas.

With over 25 years of work experience, I have been a vocal leader in B<Open
Source Software> for the last 20. I love solving problems in ways that benefit
not only my current task, but the art of programming in general. I take the
most pride in my works that help people of many programming languages at once.
I've coined this effort: L<Acmeism|http://acmeism.org>.

=head1 Career Objective

I'm one of the 3 original authors of the B<YAML Data Language>, and the only
one of those who continues to work on YAML daily. I see a future for YAML that
builds on its current success while addressing its many pitfalls, and making
it grow to solve more real world, every day needs.

Cloud Computing has been my area of daily work for past 8 years. Recently I
worked as a Distinguished Technologist at Hewlett Packard Enterprise's cloud
division. While there I worked with OpenStack, Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry,
Ansible, Concourse.ci, Swagger/OpenAPI; all of which used YAML!

Cloud continues to rely more on YAML every day. YAML needs support as an
industry language. I am ready, able and gungho to lead that effort.

I am currently looking for employment at a forward-thinking company that uses
YAML as a core part of their industry leading projects. I'd like to be able
to help the company use YAML to its full potential; work with talented people
who can help me shape the language; and lead the community effort to move it
all forward.
