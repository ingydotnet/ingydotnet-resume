=head1 Ingy döt Net

Greetings! My name is L<Ingy döt Net|http://ingy.net>. I am a software artist
and computer language inventor. My passion in life is to see computers solving
the real world problems that society faces today. To that end, I continually
look for new ideas to make software development simpler, while searching for
more ways to socialize those ideas.

With over 25 years of work experience, I have been a vocal leader in B<Open
Source Software> for the last 20. I love solving problems in ways that benefit
not only my current task, but the art of programming in general. I take the
most pride in my works that help people of many programming languages at once.
I've coined this effort: L<Acmeism|http://acmeism.org>.
