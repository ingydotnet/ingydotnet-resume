=head1 Ingy döt Net

Greetings! My name is L<Ingy döt Net|http://ingy.net>. I am a software artist
and inventor. My mission in life is to see computers solving the real world
problems that we humans face today. To that end, I continually look for new
ideas to make software development simpler, while searching for more ways to
socialize those ideas.

With over 25 years of work experience, I have been a vocal leader in B<Open
Source Software> for the last 15. I love solving problems in ways that benefit
not only my current task, but the art of programming in general. I take the
most pride in my works that help people of many programming languages at once.
I've coined this effort: L<Acmeism|http://acmeism.org>.

=head1 Objective

I am seeking contract work as a software engineer for a company that embraces
Open Source technologies, and applies agile development techniques. I desire
to work primarily as a telecommuter, in constant communication with a solid
team who can deliver innovative software on time. As a prolific inventor of
open technology, I will require permission to publish my generic software
ideas as Open Source modules and libraries.
